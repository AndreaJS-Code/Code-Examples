Assigned Program Requirements:
- Solve a second order homogeneous recurrence function
  - f(n) = a * f(n-2) + b * f(n-1)
- User provides integer values for a, b, f(0), f(1), and n
- Program displays the value of f(n)

Voluntary Feature Enhancements:
- Clear and easy-to-follow instructions
- Input validation
- Optional color-coded, step-by-step approach to evaluating the function
  - Breaks down how values are determined for f(2) through f(n)
