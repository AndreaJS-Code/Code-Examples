Assigned Program Requirements:
- Create a linked list to represent two polynomials
- User can enter polynomial terms (coefficient and exponent)
- Terms listed in decreasing order of exponents
- Menu allows user to:
  -  Add terms to either polynomial
  -  Add or subtract the polynomials
  -  Multiply one polynomial by a monomial 

Voluntary Feature Enhancements:
- The ability to randomly generate starting polynomials if the user does not want to enter them manually
- Options to modify or delete terms from the polynomials
- Extensive input validation
- Additional care taken to ensure polynomials are not printed with extraneous minus signs, coefficients or exponents with a        value of 1 or -1, or terms with repeating exponents (that should be combined into a single term)
