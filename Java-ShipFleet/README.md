Assigned Program Requirements:
- Subclasses extend Ship superclass
- Constructors, accessors, and mutators
- toString that overrides base class
- Polymorphic array

Voluntary Feature Enhancements:
- Input validation via try/catch blocks
	- User can correct invalid entries without losing previous entries
- Carefully formatted ship manifest that groups each type of ship into its own column
- Customized dialog boxes

Instructor Feedback:
"Your code is well written, designed and documented.  I see you met the problem requirements of using inheritance with the extension of the ship class.  You tested each type of ship in your testing class appropriately using a polymorphic reference.  I see that you made good use of the .this pointer.  You did a fantastic job testing your class by allowing for user input through the use of dialog boxes. I can’t say enough about your level of documentation and modularity in your testing class.  You are already ahead of the game by including the try/catch blocks in your code."
